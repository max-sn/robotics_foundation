Many of the examples of the video above appeal to the imagination of starting robot engineers such as yourselves, but in this course we will not follow the entirety of the `Modern Robotics <http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics>`__ course by Kevin Lynch and Frank Park. The examples therefore don't accurately describe the end-level of this course. It is of course highly recommended to continue *Modern Robotics* where we drop off, but it is in no way mandatory.
