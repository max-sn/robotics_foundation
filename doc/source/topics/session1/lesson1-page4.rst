Configuration space topology
============================

The video below is optional, because it is very conceptual and the concepts treated here have a low impact on how we do calculations in this course. It does however give some insight in why we treat angles as we do. It also might help you in the next video.

Take home messages:

* The difference in shape (topology) of spaces leads to different ways to represent a location in the space.
* Spaces of angles, and sets of angles have symmetrical topologies, indicated by :math:`\phi\in\mathbb{S}`, where :math:`\phi` is any angle, and :math:`\mathbb{S}` denotes the space.
* Note also that there is a difference between the configuration of a 2R robot arm, which has a configuration topology of a torus (:math:`\theta \in \mathbb{S}^{1} \times \mathbb{S}^1`), and the configuration of a pendulum which also has 2 angle coordinates but has a configuration space topology of a sphere (:math:`\theta \in \mathbb{S}^{2}`).
