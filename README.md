# Robotics Foundation scripts

This repository contains Python scripts to be used alongside the Robotics Foundation course of the [master program Robotics Systems Engineering](https://www.saxion.edu/programmes/master/robotics-systems-engineering), offered by [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://www.saxion.edu/).

These scripts are mainly intended for educational purposes and are neither optimized for efficiency nor robustness.

Future work might include Matlab&trade; versions of the Python scripts.
